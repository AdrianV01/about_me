>h1> "LJ Code 201 Day 1"</h1>
<p> I feel like I've learned quite a bit today. Admittedly there was significant review, but the one on one discussion I was able to have with the TA was exactly what I needed. It really helped me to directly address one of my issues with syntax. I think the format of the class has nice balance, though personally I might favor more lab work as it is personally more beneficial to me. </p>
