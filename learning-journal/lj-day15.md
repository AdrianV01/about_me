Today was the first day of project week, and the main thing I learned is that
planning accounts for a lot more time (at least as far as our group is concerned)
than I had initially foreseen. Division of labor was also a major concern,
particularly in a group with differing skill sets and abilities (not to mention when
the idea being used belongs to a particular member of the group). Seeing the balance
between different portions of the project (or imbalance, as it were) definitely
gives rise to apprehension, as it makes it more difficult to divide the work up
evenly.
