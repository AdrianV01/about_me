Day 11 was a day in which I tried to mostly figure things out for myself.
While I don't necessarily find it easy to do that at this stage of the game,
I was able to surprise myself by figuring out a few things that had plagued me independently.
Do I think this is likely to start a trend? No, probably not anytime soon. I still
feel like I'm being led by the hand through a swamp.
