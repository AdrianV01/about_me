<p> Today I learned next to nothing, as I assumed there would be no class due to snow and ended up at a doctors appointment I had long been putting off. I begin to become seriously concerned that I'm falling too far behind, as these labs are time consuming and I definitely need a lot of assistance. At least I got some information as to why I was experiencing such fierce abdominal pains, though.
