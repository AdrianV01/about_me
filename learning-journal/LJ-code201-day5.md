<p> Today was a difficult day in many ways, but I learned once again how important attention to detail is, and the importance of things like...I don't know...[0]. I find it much more enjoyable to work in pairs as this is very much new to me and it makes errors much easier to notice. I see that programming is basically a process of getting angry at ones self, so anything that can alleviate that is incredibly helpful.
