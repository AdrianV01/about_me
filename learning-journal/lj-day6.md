<p> Today I was lost in the labyrinthine weeds of this assignment that I found it difficult to let the lessons sink it. I feel like the challenges thrust upon us cause more frustration than anything, and I begin to have my doubts as to whether this method of "fuck you, do it" instruction is actually helpful for me at this stage.
