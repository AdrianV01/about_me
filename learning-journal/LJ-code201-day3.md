<p> Day three could quite easily be described as brutal. It seemed as if the concepts introduced were thrown together in combinations (during the lab) that required a combination of creativity and a pretty good understanding of the material. Trying to figure out how to use the loops in a way that they would actually interact with the other parts of the code, and how to even represent the ideas in code were both frustrating, especially because there is no parity between the difficulty level of a concept in itself and the difficulty level to code it. I also felt like the availability of assistance, given the number of students with problems and the ratio of teaching assistants to students, caused me to flounder on my own without guidance for quite some time. </p>
